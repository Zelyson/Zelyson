## `ps` - What I do on Github
I intend on uploading some small projects I am working on. Things such as a like a custom ping program or an image generator using a function to create some crazy art should set the tone on what to expect. These projects are just for fun and I do them to learn more about programming, computers and anything that comes up in the way of creating them.

## `exit` - Finaly words
I hope you have fun while exploring this small corner of the internet and maybe get inspired to work on your own projects in the future.
